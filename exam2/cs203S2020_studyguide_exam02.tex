\section*{Introduction}

\noindent The exam will be ``closed notes'' and ``closed book'' and it will
cover the following materials. Please review the ``Course Schedule'' on the Web
site for the course to see the content and slides that we have covered to this
date. Students may post questions about this material to our Slack workspace.

\vspace*{-.5em}
\begin{itemize}

  \itemsep 0in

  \item Chapters 1 through 6 and 12 through 15 and 16 through 18 in \philosophy{}.

  \item Chapters 1 through 7 and 9 through 14 in \cooperative{}.

  \item Chapters 1 through 5 in \pytest{}.

  \item Selected chapters from 1 through 19 in \programmingstyle{}.

  \item All relevant chapters in \thinkpython{} (e.g., be able to write and
    document a Python program).

  \item All design, implementation, and testing details for the first long-term
    software project.

  \item Your class notes, class activities, lecture slides, and the first seven
    practical assignments.

  \item Knowledge of the basic commands necessary for using Git and GitHub;
    understanding of the ``GitHub Flow'' model for collaboration; basic
    understanding of the Markdown syntax.

  \item The concepts introduced and reviewed during the laboratory and practical
    sessions (e.g., the key programming styles and how to use testing and
    linting tools in the Python language).

  \item Lessons learned from the team-based implementation and delivery of
    real-world software.

\end{itemize}
\vspace*{-.5em}

\noindent The examination will include a mix of questions that will require you
to draw and/or comment on a diagram, write a short answer, explain and/or write
a source code segment, or give and comment on a list of concepts or points. The
emphasis will be on the following list of illustrative subjects. Please note
that this list is not exhaustive --- rather it is designed to suggest
representative topics.

When studying for the test, don't forget that the Web site for our course
contains mobile-ready slides that will provide you with an overview of the key
concepts that we discussed in the previous modules. You can use the color scheme
in the slides to notice points where we, for instance, completed an in-class
activity, discussed a key point, or made reference to additional details
available in the one of the textbooks. If students have questions about the
material on this review sheet, then they should schedule a meeting with the
instructor or ask a question in Slack.

\section*{Reminder Concerning the Honor Code}

\vspace*{-.025in}

\noindent Students are required to fully adhere to the Honor Code during the
completion of this exam. More details about the Allegheny College Honor Code are
provided on the syllabus. Students are strongly encouraged to carefully review
the full statement of the Honor Code before taking this exam. If you do not
understand Allegheny College's Honor Code, please schedule a meeting with the
instructor.

The following is a review of Honor Code statement from the course
syllabus:

\begin{quote}
  The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
  Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor
  Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet
  non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all
  work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and
  the final project). All students who have enrolled in the College will work
  under the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has
  acknowledged the following pledge:
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in
  the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College
  community as a whole.
\end{quote}
