\section*{Introduction}

Requiring students to provide answers in a Markdown file, the final examination
for this course will be administered through GitHub Classroom and GitHub. You
will receive access to the online examination at \releasedtime{} on
\assignmentassignedate{}, 2020.
%
Although the course instructor anticipates that the examination will require
students to dedicate about three hours to its completion, every student will
have until \duetime{} on May 4, 2020 to submit their final examination.
%
The exam will be ``closed notes'' and ``closed book'' and it will cover the
following materials. Please review the ``Course Schedule'' on the Web site for
the course to see the content and slides that we have covered to this date.
Students may post questions about this material to our Slack workspace. The
instructor encourages students to form online study groups to review for this
upcoming examination.

\vspace*{-.5em}
\begin{itemize}

  \itemsep 0.05in

  \item Chapters 1 through 6 and 12 through 15 in \philosophy{}.

  \item Chapters 1 through 7 and 9 through 12 in \cooperative{}.

  \item Chapters 1 through 5 in \pytest{}.

  \item Selected chapters from 1 through 19 in \programmingstyle{}.

  \item All relevant chapters in \thinkpython{} (e.g., be able to write and
    document a Python program).

  \item All design, implementation, and testing details for the first long-term
    software project.

  \item Your class notes, class activities, lecture slides, and details on the
    eight practical assignments.

  \item Knowledge of the basic commands necessary for using Git and GitHub;
    understanding of the ``GitHub Flow'' model for collaboration; basic
    understanding of the Markdown syntax.

  \item The concepts introduced and reviewed during the laboratory and practical
    sessions (e.g., the key programming styles and how to use testing and
    linting tools in the Python language).

  \item Lessons learned from the team-based implementation and delivery of
    real-world software.

\end{itemize}
\vspace*{-.5em}

The examination will include a mix of questions that will require you to draw
and/or comment on a technical diagram, write a short answer, explain, write, or
test a source code segment, or furnish and explain a list of technical concepts.
%
When students are asked to draw a technical diagram they must create it in a
tool like \url{https://excalidraw.com/}, export the diagram to a PNG or SVG
graphic file, and then transfer the graphic file to their remote GitHub
repository.

The emphasis will be on the following list of illustrative subjects. Please note
that this list is not exhaustive --- rather it is designed to suggest
representative topics.
%
When studying for the test, don't forget that the Web site for our course
contains mobile-ready slides that will provide you with an overview of the key
concepts that we discussed throughout the semester.

\section*{Reminder Concerning the Honor Code}

\vspace*{-.02in}

\noindent Students are required to fully adhere to the Honor Code during the
completion of this exam. More details about the Allegheny College Honor Code are
provided on the syllabus. Students are strongly encouraged to carefully review
the full statement of the Honor Code before taking this exam. If you do not
understand Allegheny College's Honor Code, please schedule a meeting with the
instructor.

\vspace*{.1in}

The following is a review of Honor Code statement from the course
syllabus:

\begin{quote}
  The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
  Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor
  Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet
  non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all
  work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and
  the final project). All students who have enrolled in the College will work
  under the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has
  acknowledged the following pledge:
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in
  the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College
  community as a whole.
\end{quote}
