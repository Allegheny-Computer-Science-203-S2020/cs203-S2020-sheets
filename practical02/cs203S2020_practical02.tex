\section*{Objectives}

To practice using GitHub to access the files for a practical assignment.
Additionally, to practice using your laptop's operating system and software
development programs such as a ``terminal window'' and a ``testing tool''. You
will also continue to practice using Slack to support communication with the
technical leaders and the course instructor. Next, you will learn how to
implement and run a Python program, also discovering how to use the Pipenv tool
and the course's automated grading tool to assess your progress towards
correctly completing the project. Finally, you will explore how to perform
automated testing with Pytest and a program in the cookbook style.

\section*{Suggestions for Success}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item {\bf Follow each step carefully}. Slowly read each sentence in the
  assignment sheet, making sure that you precisely follow each instruction. Take
  notes about each step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas and
  the challenges that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell a technical
  leader or instructor what assignment step you recently completed.

\item {\bf Regularly ask and answer questions}. Please log into Slack at the
  start of a laboratory or practical session and then join the appropriate
  channel. If you have a question about one of the steps in an assignment, then
  you can post it to the designated channel. Or, you can ask a student sitting
  next to you or talk with a technical leader or the course instructor.

\item {\bf Store your files in GitHub}. Starting with this laboratory
  assignment, you will be responsible for storing all of your files (e.g., Java
  source code and Markdown-based writing) in a Git repository using GitHub
  Classroom. Please verify that you have saved your source code in your Git
  repository by using \command{git status} to ensure that everything is
  updated. You can see if your assignment submission meets the established
  correctness requirements by using the provided checking tools on your local
  computer and by checking the commits in GitHub.

\item {\bf Keep all of your files}. Don't delete your programs, output files,
  and written reports after you submit them through GitHub; you will need them
  again when you study for the quizzes and examinations and work on the other
  laboratory, practical, and final project assignments.

\item {\bf Explore teamwork and technologies}. While certain aspects of the
  laboratory assignments will be challenging for you, each part is designed to
  give you the opportunity to learn both fundamental concepts in the field of
  computer science and explore advanced technologies that are commonly employed
  at a wide variety of companies. To explore and develop new ideas, you should
  regularly communicate with your team and/or the student technical leaders.

\item {\bf Hone your technical writing skills}. Computer science assignments
  require to you write technical documentation and descriptions of your
  experiences when completing each task. Take extra care to ensure that your
  writing is interesting and both grammatically and technically correct,
  remembering that computer scientists must effectively communicate and
  collaborate with their team members and the student technical leaders and
  course instructor.

\item {\bf Review the Honor Code on the syllabus}. While you may discuss your
  assignments with others, copying source code or writing is a violation of
  Allegheny College's Honor Code.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading Assignment}

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant ``GitHub
Guides'', available at \url{https://guides.github.com/}, that explain how to
use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure
that you have read guides such as ``Mastering Markdown'' and ``Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub''; each of them will help you to understand how to use both
GitHub and GitHub Classroom. To do well on this assignment, you should also
read Chapters 1 through 3 in {\em Think Python\/} and the Preface and Chapters
1 through 4 in the {\em Exercises in Programming Style\/}.
%
You are also expected to find and read all of the online resources that you
need to complete this assignment.
%
You should also read the first two chapters in the Pytest book.

\section*{Debugging and Testing a Cookbook Python Program}

To access the practical assignment, you should go into the
\channel{\#announcements} channel in our Slack team and find the announcement
that provides a link for it. Copy this link and paste it into your web browser.
Now, you should accept the practical assignment and see that GitHub Classroom
created a new GitHub repository for you to access the assignment's starting
materials and to store the completed version of your assignment. Specifically,
to access your new GitHub repository for this assignment, please click the green
``Accept'' button and then click the link that is prefaced with the label ``Your
assignment has been created here''. If you accepted the assignment and correctly
followed these steps, you should have created a GitHub repository with a name
like
``Allegheny-Computer-Science-203-Spring-2020/computer-science-203-spring-2020-practical-2-gkapfham''.
Unless you provide the instructor with documentation of the extenuating
circumstances that you are facing, not accepting the assignment means that you
automatically receive a failing grade for it. Now, remember that your home base
for this assignment is the directory that contains all of the configuration
files and the \command{termfrequency/} directory. Can you find the program and
its tests?

% Make sure that you can find your ``home base'' for this practical assignment!
% Please see the instructor if you are stuck on getting started.

Study the provided source code and the technical documentation to understand the
type of output that your program should produce.
%
At the outset, you should notice that the provided source code does not contain
all of the source code from Chapter 4 of the book. You will need to add in the
appropriate source code and documentation to ensure that the Python program
passes all of the checks and produces the correct output.
%
Please remember that, when you start this practical assignment, the provided
Python source code will both not pass the linting checks and not produce the
correct output.
%
As you are adding the required code, you should also run the Pytest test suite
that currently contains one test. Following the strategy of this test and the
documentation for the functions in the program, please add at least four more
tests to establish a confidence in the correctness of the cookbook-style
program.
%
Please make sure that your test cases have assertions that can distinguish
between correct and incorrect function outputs.
%
If you have already installed Pipenv and the project's development dependencies,
you can run the tests by typing \command{pipenv run test}. How does this testing
strategy compare to the one in the \mbox{last practical?} What are the benefits
and drawbacks associated with testing through the use of Pytest?

\section*{Checking the Correctness of Your Program and Writing}

In addition to using your own automated Pytest-based tests, you can use
GatorGrader to check other characteristics of your project. To automatically
check your Python source code you can get started with the use of the
GatorGrader tool, typing the command \gatorgraderstart{} in your terminal
window.
%
Once your program is running correctly, fulfilling at least some of the
assignment's requirements, you should transfer your files to GitHub using the
\gitcommit{} and \gitpush{} commands. For example, if you want to signal that
the \mainprogramsource{} file has been changed and is ready for transfer to
GitHub you would first type \gitcommitmainprogram{} in your terminal, followed
by typing \gitpush{} and checking to see that the transfer to GitHub is
successful. If you notice that transferring your Python source code to GitHub
did not work correctly, then please try to determine why, asking a technical
leader or the course instructor for assistance, if necessary.

After the course instructor enables \step{continuous integration} with a system
called Travis CI, when you use the \gitpush{} command to transfer your source
code to your GitHub repository, Travis CI will initialize a \step{build} of
your assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both
your source code and writing meet all of the established requirements, then you
will see a green \checkmark{} in the listing of commits in GitHub after awhile.
If your submission does not meet the requirements, a red \naughtmark{} will
appear instead. The instructor will reduce a student's grade for this
assignment if the red \naughtmark{} appears on the last commit in GitHub
immediately before the assignment's due date. Yet, if the green \checkmark{}
appears on the last commit in your GitHub repository, then you satisfied all of
the main checks, leading to further assessment of your project. Unless you
provide the course instructor with documentation of the severe and extenuating
circumstances that you are facing, no late work will be considered towards your
completion grade for this practical assignment.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

\noindent Students do not need to submit printed source code or technical
writing for any assignment in this course. Instead, this assignment invites you
to submit, using GitHub, the following deliverables.

\begin{enumerate}

\setlength{\itemsep}{0in}

\item A properly documented, well-formatted, and correct version of
  \mainprogramsource{} that both meets all of the established requirements and
  produces the desired output.

\item A properly documented, well-formatted, and correct version of
  \testprogramsource{} that contains at least five passing tests and produces
  the anticipated diagnostic output.

\item Stored in a Markdown file called \reflection{}, a multiple-paragraph
  response for each of the stated prompts, including details about test suite
  output in a fenced code block and completed lists of details about Python
  source code and additional supporting files.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Evaluation of Your Practical Assignment}

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through the commit log in
GitHub, you will privately received a grade on this assignment and feedback on
your submitted deliverables. Your grade for the assignment will be a function of
the whether or not it was submitted in a timely fashion and if your program
received a green \checkmark{} indicating that it met all of the requirements.
Other factors will also influence your final grade on the assignment. In
addition to studying the efficiency and effectiveness and documentation of your
Python source code, the instructor will also evaluate the correctness of your
technical writing. If your submission receives a red \naughtmark{}, the
instructor will reduce your grade for the assignment. Please remember to read
your GitHub repository's \program{README.md} file for a description of the four
grades that you will receive for this practical assignment. Students should
follow the instructions in the \program{README.md} file to ask the instructor to
review their assignment and to provide you with constructive feedback before you
submit it for the final assessment.

\section*{Adhering to the Honor Code}

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an
individual basis. While it is appropriate for students in this class to have
high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem
with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or
merely variations on, someone else's work. Deliverables (e.g., Python source
code) that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence
of violating the \mbox{Honor Code}. Please see the course instructor during
office hours if you have questions about the Honor Code policy.
