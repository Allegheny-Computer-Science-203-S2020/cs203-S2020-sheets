\section*{Objectives}

To practice using GitHub to access the files for a practical assignment.
Additionally, to practice using the Ubuntu operating system and software
development programs such as a ``terminal window'' and a ``testing tool''. You
will also continue to practice using Slack to support communication with the
teaching assistants and the course instructor. You will carry on with practice
in implementing and running a Python program and also using Pytest and the
course's automated grading tool to assess your progress towards correctly
completing the project. Along with discovering and learning how to use new
Pytest plugins, you will start to look for and, if possible, fix ``red flags''
in your system's design (e.g., ``repetition'' and ``vague name'' and ``comment
repeats code''). You will continue to document deficiencies of the ``cookbook
program style'' and practice how to automatically and manually perform its
debugging and testing with Pytest and Pytest plugins.

\section*{Suggestions for Success}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item {\bf Follow each step carefully}. Slowly read each sentence in the
  assignment sheet, making sure that you precisely follow each instruction. Take
  notes about each step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas and
  the challenges that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell a technical
  leader or instructor what assignment step you recently completed.

\item {\bf Regularly ask and answer questions}. Please log into Slack at the
  start of a laboratory or practical session and then join the appropriate
  channel. If you have a question about one of the steps in an assignment, then
  you can post it to the designated channel. Or, you can ask a student sitting
  next to you or talk with a technical leader or the course instructor.

\item {\bf Store your files in GitHub}. Starting with this laboratory
  assignment, you will be responsible for storing all of your files (e.g., Java
  source code and Markdown-based writing) in a Git repository using GitHub
  Classroom. Please verify that you have saved your source code in your Git
  repository by using \command{git status} to ensure that everything is
  updated. You can see if your assignment submission meets the established
  correctness requirements by using the provided checking tools on your local
  computer and by checking the commits in GitHub.

\item {\bf Keep all of your files}. Don't delete your programs, output files,
  and written reports after you submit them through GitHub; you will need them
  again when you study for the quizzes and examinations and work on the other
  laboratory, practical, and final project assignments.

\item {\bf Explore teamwork and technologies}. While certain aspects of the
  laboratory assignments will be challenging for you, each part is designed to
  give you the opportunity to learn both fundamental concepts in the field of
  computer science and explore advanced technologies that are commonly employed
  at a wide variety of companies. To explore and develop new ideas, you should
  regularly communicate with your team and/or the student technical leaders.

\item {\bf Hone your technical writing skills}. Computer science assignments
  require to you write technical documentation and descriptions of your
  experiences when completing each task. Take extra care to ensure that your
  writing is interesting and both grammatically and technically correct,
  remembering that computer scientists must effectively communicate and
  collaborate with their team members and the student technical leaders and
  course instructor.

\item {\bf Review the Honor Code on the syllabus}. While you may discuss your
  assignments with others, copying source code or writing is a violation of
  Allegheny College's Honor Code.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading Assignment}

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant ``GitHub
Guides'', available at \url{https://guides.github.com/}, that explain how to use
many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that
you have read guides such as ``Mastering Markdown'' and ``Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub''; each of them will help you to understand how to use both
GitHub and GitHub Classroom. To do well on this assignment, you should also read
Chapters 1 through 3 in {\em Think Python\/} and the Preface and Chapters 1
through 4 in the {\em Exercises in Programming Style\/}.
%
You should also read the first two chapters in the \pytest, making sure that you
understand this tool's command-line arguments.
%
Please make sure that you carefully review the listing of ``red flags'' in the
appendix of \philosophy.
%
You are also expected to find and read all of the online resources that you need
to complete this assignment.

\section*{Discovering the Limitations Imposed by the Cookbook Style}

To access the practical assignment, you should go into the
\channel{\#announcements} channel in our Slack team and find the announcement
that provides a link for it. Copy this link and paste it into your web browser.
Now, you should accept the practical assignment and see that GitHub Classroom
created a new GitHub repository for you to access the assignment's starting
materials and to store the completed version of your assignment. Specifically,
to access your new GitHub repository for this assignment, please click the green
``Accept'' button and then click the link that is prefaced with the label ``Your
assignment has been created here''. If you accepted the assignment and correctly
followed these steps, you should have created a GitHub repository with a name
like
``Allegheny-Computer-Science-203-Spring-2020/computer-science-203-spring-2020-practical-4-gkapfham''.
Unless you provide the instructor with documentation of the extenuating
circumstances that you are facing, not accepting the assignment means that you
automatically receive a failing grade for it.

% Now, remember that your home base for this assignment is the directory that
% contains all of the configuration files and the \command{termfrequency/}
% directory. Can you find the program and its tests?

Study the provided source code and the technical documentation to understand the
type of output that your program produces.
%
As you are adding all of the required code, you should also run the Pytest test
suite that currently contains one test. Following the strategy of this test and
the documentation for the functions in the program, add all of the test cases
that you previously developed for this program.
%
If you have already installed Pipenv and the project's development dependencies,
you can run the tests by typing \command{pipenv run test}.
%
After that, please try to use Pytest plugins like \program{pytest-clarity} and
\program{pytest-sugar} and observing how they help you to be a better tester.
%
Finally, review the ``red flags'' associated with poor software designs and try
to take steps to refactor the Python program and tests --- while preserving the
style --- to avoid those concerns, documenting your steps.
%
Instead of fully repairing the provided program, the point of this assignment is
to develop your awareness of red flags and to address those problems that you
can (e.g., problems with source code documentation) without stepping outside of
the program style.
%
In follow-on assignments you will learn more about how to overcome the
deficiencies inherent in this style.
%
For instance, parameterized unit testing is more feasible if functions accept
parameters!

\section*{Checking the Correctness of Your Program and Writing}

In addition to using your own automated Pytest-based tests, you can use
GatorGrader to check other characteristics of your project. To automatically
check your Python source code you can get started with the use of the
GatorGrader tool, typing the command \gatorgraderstart{} in your terminal
window.
%
Once your program is running correctly, fulfilling at least some of the
assignment's requirements, you should transfer your files to GitHub using the
\gitcommit{} and \gitpush{} commands. For example, if you want to signal that
the \testprogramsource{} file has been changed and is ready for transfer to
GitHub you would first type \gitcommittestprogram{} in your terminal, followed
by typing \gitpush{} and checking to see that the transfer to GitHub is
successful.

% If you notice that transferring your Python source code to GitHub
% did not work correctly, then please try to determine why, asking a teaching
% assistant or the course instructor for assistance, if necessary.

After the course instructor enables \step{continuous integration} with a system
called Travis CI, when you use the \gitpush{} command to transfer your source
code to your GitHub repository, Travis CI will initialize a \step{build} of your
assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both your
source code and writing meet all of the established requirements, then you will
see a green \checkmark{} in the listing of commits in GitHub after awhile. If
your submission does not meet the requirements, a red \naughtmark{} will appear
instead. The instructor will reduce a student's grade for this assignment if the
red \naughtmark{} appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the
assignment's due date. Yet, if the green \checkmark{} appears on the last commit
in your GitHub repository, then you satisfied all of the main checks and you
will earn full credit. Unless you provide the course instructor with
documentation of the severe and extenuating circumstances that you are facing,
no late work will be considered towards your completion grade for this practical
assignment.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

\noindent Students do not need to submit printed source code or technical
writing for any assignment in this course. Instead, this assignment invites you
to submit, using GitHub, the following deliverables.

\vspace*{-.25em}

\begin{enumerate}

\setlength{\itemsep}{0in}

\item A properly documented, well-formatted, and correct version of
  \testprogramsource{} that contains at least five passing tests and produces
  the desired diagnostic output.

\item A revised version of \mainprogramsource{} that, when appropriate, contains
  refactored source code that avoids the ``red flags'' mentioned in \philosophy.
  While you should try to further improve this program, you do not need to
  refactor it to overcome the limitations that prevent the use of parameterized
  test cases in Pytest.

\item Stored in a Markdown file called \reflection{}, a multiple-paragraph
  response, with each paragraph consisting of at least 100 words, for each of
  the stated prompts. This file should also feature a fenced code block that
  furnish source code and output from running a test suite. Please make sure
  that you identify and explain some new Pytest plugins that we can consider
  using during the development of the long-term software engineering project.

\end{enumerate}

\vspace*{-1em}

\section*{Evaluation of Your Practical Assignment}

Practical assignments are graded on a completion --- or ``checkmark'' --- basis.
If your GitHub repository has a \checkmark{} for the last commit before the
deadline then you will receive the highest possible grade for the assignment.
However, you will fail the assignment if you do not complete it correctly, as
evidenced by a red \naughtmark{} in your commit listing, by the set deadline for
completing the project.

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an
individual basis. While it is appropriate for students in this class to have
high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem
with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or
merely variations on, someone else's work. Deliverables (e.g., Python source
code) that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence
of violating the \mbox{Honor Code}. Please see the course instructor during
office hours if you have questions about the Honor Code policy.
